# DeathBarn
### Team Deathmatch Map (FPS) - Powered by Unreal Editor - Games are Hard

'DeathBarn' is a re-mastered TDM map from the Variety map pack of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, designed and built using free components in UDK Editor. Inspired by the tutorial level “F.N.G”. It is a symmetrical map with a looking post in the middle. It is the home to very fierce battles as the map is no longer than 'Shipment' map from COD4.

The strategic elements of core areas of this map are basically common for both teams. There is one specific algorithm that human thinks when he is playing that type of games. First person games. The only things that matters are to eliminate the opponents team and reach the highest frag score. One important thing is when the map has theoritically balanced the winning and loosing chances on both sides. There are strategic placed power ups which gives the same opportunities to both teams to win the game. First things first, it has a Kill Box which is the area that is mostly at the center of map and it’s the area where things gone wild. Another place that we can say that is risky and draws the attention of all players playing this game type. It’s called Choke Points. Generally talking it is a tight area where multiple players fight for control of the area. Typically the defending players have the upper hand in this situation. Sometimes choke points may lead to a kill box or a safe zone.

## Philosophies of Design
“…define the dominant engagement range of the map, carve out the main paths to force players into head-to-head battles, establish ‘destinations’ where players want to fight for dominance...” 
-	Philip Tasker, Lead Level Designer for Treyarch (Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty: Black Ops) 

“by the second or third time [a player steps into a level], players should start to have a strong understanding of all the major locations and pathways throughout the level… [so that] they’re executing their own strategies and not struggling to figure out where they are” 
-	Adam Crist, Design Lead for Certain Affinity (multiplayer and map developers for CoD: W@W, CoD:Black Ios, Halo Reach)
